# E-Sport Earnings
E-sport has grown in attention, proffesionalism and popularity the last couple of yers. This datasets contains info about 500 games from 1981 to 2021. The initial hypothesis is that the earnings and tournaments are centered around a few newer games, whereas the rest lag behind significantly. A structured Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is performed to gain insight. The following conclusions has been drawn from the process:
  * con1
  * con2
  * con3

# Basic Exploration and Data Cleaning
After a quick exploration the following subjects and issues where identified:
  * There are 513 unique games from the period 1981 - 2020 
  * Data is aggregated so each game appears with one row with a total of 7 columns. 
  * There are no missing values and datatypes are correct
  * The variability is huge for alle the columns (eg. Range for total earnings is 0 - 2,2e+08)

## Univariate Exploration
I start by looking further into how the variability/dispersion is for each column.
SHOW MAJOR FINDINGS WITH SOME GRAPHS 
Since the top nth games make up more than 90 % of the earnings we split the data into a top nth.

## Bivariate Exploration

## Multivariate exploration
